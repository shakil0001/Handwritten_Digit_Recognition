The handwritten digit recognition using the Keras and open CV.
This is a project, which is based on develop a deep learning model to achieve near state of the art performance on the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task in Python using the Keras deep learning library.
  In this project, we are going to recognize the handwritten numbers using special type of networks called convolutional neural networks and Keras Library.
